  ###
    Responsible for defining all the relational operations between
    schemas as defined by a valid relation.json config file

    ###
      Method: constructor
      
      Delegates build operations to build
      specific _relation object.

      Schemas collection used to inject specific
      instance methods into each model.

      Also pass in a reference to the models object which
      at this point is uninitialized. will soon be populated
      with model objects that communicate directly to the mongo
      database.

      child_plugin requires a reference to models in order to carry
      out Relational Proxy operations.
    ###
    constructor: (schemas, models) ->
      @_schemas = schemas
      @_models = models


    ###
      Method: addRelationship  (Synchronous)

      Creates a relationship between node1 and node2 of type, type. Valid
      types are
        "parent_child"
        "orphan"

      Orphan types will add the model to the orphaned collections.
